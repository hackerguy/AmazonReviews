Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.</td>\n",

       "0  Good USA company that stands behind their products. I have had to warranty two hoses and they send replacements right out to you. I had one burst after awhile, you could see it buldge for weeks before it went so no suprises. The other one was winter related as I am bad and leave them out most of the time. Highly reccomend. Note the hundred footer is heavy and like wresting an anaconda when its time to put away, but it does have a far reach.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              \n",

       "2  It's probably one of the best hoses I've ever had.Pro's:- It's good enough for most front yards, or small back yards.- It has enough flow (and with the right head) to water plants 25ft away from the nozzle, and water your garden.- It's light weight, and flexible (it does not pose as much of a problem unrolling this hose with kinks as with other hoses I've owned)- The hose is flexible, yet strong. I haven't cut the outside yet.- This hose has been in full sunlight for more than 3 months, and the rubber hasn't cracked yet! I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!   \n",
       "3  I probably should have bought something a bit more flexible and less rugged since I constantly coil/uncoil it for washing cars, but that's my fault not a product fault.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  \n",
       "4  I bought three of these 5/8-inch Flexogen hoses--50, 75, and 100 feet--for different areas of yard around the house.  After a season of use they've proven to be good hoses.  Of course, it's very favorable that they don't leak.  But what particularly impresses me about them is their notably light weight and flexibility, which make them a lot easier to handle than my previous hoses.  The flexibility diminishes in cold weather, but a garden hose is less useful then anyway.They're not especially prone to kinking, but they're not kink-proof, either, nor do they claim to be.  They kink a lot less than one of my old hoses and more than a couple of others, but the latter were fairly stiff, so there was a trade-off.Bottom line:  this was a good purchase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",

       "      <td>I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:&gt;For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.&gt;The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.&gt;The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.&gt;It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.&gt;The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).&gt;It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:&gt;This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.&gt;The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.&gt;The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.&gt;Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.&gt;The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.&gt;Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.&gt;I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.&gt;While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the \"nose\" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.&gt;Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain \"jump the track.\"  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.&gt;The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs.</td>\n",

I believe it's good quality rubber.cons:- Like with every hose, keeping it outside in the sunshine, the water warms up and starts smelling.My dog don't want to drink from the water coming from this hose.- The hose is only in one color (I wished it was a little less visible in the gardenOtherwise this hose is an excellent garden tool!I bought 2 of them, one 25ft for my front garden, and 50ft for my rear garden.3-4months and still in excellent condition!                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                \n",
       "1  I'll buy more of these come  Spring. Holding up very well to the extreme heat and cold of Idaho.

       "4  I've had my Raintrain for a little over a year now.  I was initially very enthusiastic about it, but over time, I grew less satisfied with it.Pros:>For some reason, it's mesmerizing to watch.  After I get it set up, I always watch for a few moments to make sure the water throw is adjusted properly, and then I find myself watching it longer than necessary.  There's just something cool and relaxing about how the arms spin and the wheels turn and how it slowly moves along.  From talking to some other people who own this and similar products, \"sprinkler watching\" seems to be a common phenomenon.>The coarse spray is ideal for use in windy areas.  You'll get a lot less drift and evaporation using this than you would with a finer-droplet sprinkler.>The adjustability is impressive.  I have a long, 4-foot swatch of grass that would be difficult to water with most other sprinklers, but on the Raintrain, I can point the arms way down and keep the water where I want it.  But I can also point the arms way up and throw the water for at least 50 feet.>It's quiet.  The only sound it makes is the water hitting the grass.>The shut-off feature is very handy and worked quite well (initially).>It stands up well to neglect.  I left both my sprinkler and the stop block sitting outside in the sun and snow all winter, and come spring, they seemed no worse for wear.  Also, you are supposed to disconnect the sprinkler and let it drain after each use, and I've never done that, with no apparent effect yet.Cons:>This thing is really heavy, as it needs to be, but when you're hauling it out to the north forty (okay, the back of a 6500-square-foot lawn), it's a little cumbersome.>The hose connection is awkwardly placed.  It's in the somewhat narrow space at the back between the wheels, so I find it a little difficult to get a good grip on the connector.  There are also two inexplicable protrusions in the body of the sprinkler right next to the connector, and this makes it even harder to grip.  This is why I never drain my sprinkler like I'm supposed to; I hate connecting it.>The connector always leaks, even after I put in a gasket, and the hose sometimes loosens while it's traveling.>Getting the water to throw just the right distance is a pain.  You have to turn on the water, see where it's throwing, turn it off, walk out to the sprinkler, adjust the arms, walk back to the faucet, turn it on, see if that's right, and then repeat until you have it where you want it, which might involve several tries.>The water is thrown in a circle, but only to the outside of the circle.  This is easily seen if you have the sprinkler set where it will be thrown on concrete.  You can see the arc of the circle and the dry area inside it.  The way the Raintrain gets all the ground covered is by advancing this outline through the yard.  For this reason, the stationary setting on the sprinkler is useless.  It will water the outline of the circle only.>Because of the circle outline problem, the area at the beginning and end of the course will get half as much water as the rest of the yard (the beginning of the course will only be hit by the trailing edge of the circle, and the end of the course will only be hit by the front edge).  To compensate for this, I turn off the water, pick up the Raintrain, and move it back at both the beginning and end so that the areas get covered by the half circle twice.  This creates a lot of extra work for what I was hoping would be a labor-saver.>I found that the Raintrain doesn't deliver nearly as much water as it says it will.  The farther you throw the water, the less depth of water you'll put out (because the same amount of water is being spread out over a bigger area), but when I had the arms adjusted for a pretty narrow path, I only measured about a quarter inch of water (even on \"low gear,\" which makes it travel more slowly).  This likely explains why I've struggled so much with keeping my lawn green since I got the Raintrain.  With stationary sprinklers, you can leave them running as long as necessary to achieve the water delivery you need.  But with the Raintrain, if you need more water than it delivers, your only option is to lay out the hose again and start it over, which is a lot of extra work.>While the sprinkler seems overall pretty solid and durable, I knocked a big chip of paint off the \"nose\" when I set it up on end to attach the hose, and the bare spot rusted immediately.>Laying out the hose for a straight line is simple, but if you want to do any curves, it takes a lot of practice and trial and error to create a path that won't make the Raintrain \"jump the track.\"  The tightness of curve it can handle depends on several factors, such as the height and density of the grass, the softness of the ground, and any small bits of yard debris the wheels might go over.>The stop valve on the underside (which is triggered by the stop block) stopped working on mine during its second season.  Now when it runs over the stop block, it slows down, and the arms start turning more slowly, but it doesn't actually stop.  This greatly reduced the handiness of the Raintrain for me.Overall, this is a fun sprinkler, and it has its uses, but I've decided to try something else this summer.  The Raintrain is just too cumbersome and time-consuming to set up for my particular needs.   \n",

We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.</td>\n",

Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - \"Flexogen\". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say \"This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee\". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.</td>\n",

Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.</td>\n",

       "0  I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid (I'm 61).  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem.  First of all, this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move.  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects, get something else.  It has to be moved.  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction.  I have found I have to check on it as often, if not more often, than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler.  First, it jumped off the hose/track and was climbing the fence.  Then, it kinked the hose and cut off the water.  Finally, it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels.  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water.  No kink this time, checked the button on the bottom, couldn't get it going again.  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler.  At least it's easy to move around.  I think you need to use this on a very flat, very straight lawn.  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves.  It didn't work for me.  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       \n",
       "1  I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee. After a short time, the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement. A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement. Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty! Now Gilmour is selling them. But it's the same hose - \"Flexogen\". The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually, I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I have.Keep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them. Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose. Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company (Gilmour) won't honor the warranty. And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or two.Let me reiterate, Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses. I wrote to them multiple times and was told (without explanation) that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses. If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty, you may not get it.On the Gilmour website, there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced.  On Amazon, it does say \"This heavy-duty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee\". It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package. Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp., so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement.                                                \n",
       "2  The bee guards worked great but the reason I gave it only three stars is the price. Over a buck a piece is more than it should be in my option.

       "3  I read the other reviewers who had similar problems before I bought this.  I also read the reviews raving about this hose.  Since these hoses are maid from remnants; I suppose its a matter of luck as to which hose you get.  My luck wasn't good.  The hose had permanent kinks and the vinyl skin had bubbles where it was separating from the hose.Returned it immediately.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "4  Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton. Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22-inch Weber with hinged grate that I love.The WSJ is small, somewhat solidly constructed (mine, while unused, has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover - not good).However, most folks use this Weber as a portable grill. Weber, for gawd's sakes, incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle! (i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degrees).The stove's best feature, the ability to cook using fewer coals, is also its drawback. This stove is best suited for slow cooking, delicate kebabs, fish, hot dogs, and burgers - not for hot, quick searing and grilling of thick steaks.Other drawbacks are the vents, which do not (at least on my unit) rotate smoothly. And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers - i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stove.Also, being lightweight, this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session, resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals - especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height (cooking on the ground with this thing can be down, but for many folks, may be uncomfortable). I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legs?All in all, this stove is OK - it gets the job done. I like Weber products, even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 years.I hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18-inch (given away), my 22-inch (8 years going strong), and newest acquistion, the Smokey Joe Silver.   \n",

       "0  I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid I'm 61  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem  First of all this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects get something else  It has to be moved  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction  I have found I have to check on it as often if not more often than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler  First it jumped off the hosetrack and was climbing the fence  Then it kinked the hose and cut off the water  Finally it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water  No kink this time checked the button on the bottom couldn't get it going again  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler  At least it's easy to move around  I think you need to use this on a very flat very straight lawn  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves  It didn't work for me  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          \n",

       "1  I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee After a short time the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty Now Gilmour is selling them But it's the same hose  Flexogen The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I haveKeep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company Gilmour won't honor the warranty And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or twoLet me reiterate Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses I wrote to them multiple times and was told without explanation that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty you may not get itOn the Gilmour website there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced  On Amazon it does say This heavyduty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement                        \n",

       "0  I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid I'm 61  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem  First of all this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects get something else  It has to be moved  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction  I have found I have to check on it as often if not more often than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler  First it jumped off the hosetrack and was climbing the fence  Then it kinked the hose and cut off the water  Finally it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water  No kink this time checked the button on the bottom couldn't get it going again  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler  At least it's easy to move around  I think you need to use this on a very flat very straight lawn  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves  It didn't work for me  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",

       "0  I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid I'm 61  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem  First of all this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects get something else  It has to be moved  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction  I have found I have to check on it as often if not more often than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler  First it jumped off the hosetrack and was climbing the fence  Then it kinked the hose and cut off the water  Finally it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water  No kink this time checked the button on the bottom couldn't get it going again  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler  At least it's easy to move around  I think you need to use this on a very flat very straight lawn  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves  It didn't work for me  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1  I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee After a short time the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty Now Gilmour is selling them But it's the same hose  Flexogen The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I haveKeep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company Gilmour won't honor the warranty And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or twoLet me reiterate Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses I wrote to them multiple times and was told without explanation that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty you may not get itOn the Gilmour website there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced  On Amazon it does say This heavyduty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement                         \n",

       "0  I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid I'm 61  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem  First of all this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects get something else  It has to be moved  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction  I have found I have to check on it as often if not more often than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler  First it jumped off the hosetrack and was climbing the fence  Then it kinked the hose and cut off the water  Finally it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water  No kink this time checked the button on the bottom couldn't get it going again  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler  At least it's easy to move around  I think you need to use this on a very flat very straight lawn  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves  It didn't work for me  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1  I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee After a short time the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty Now Gilmour is selling them But it's the same hose  Flexogen The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I haveKeep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company Gilmour won't honor the warranty And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or twoLet me reiterate Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses I wrote to them multiple times and was told without explanation that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty you may not get itOn the Gilmour website there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced  On Amazon it does say This heavyduty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement                         \n",

       "4  Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22inch Weber with hinged grate that I loveThe WSJ is small somewhat solidly constructed mine while unused has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover  not goodHowever most folks use this Weber as a portable grill Weber for gawd's sakes incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degreesThe stove's best feature the ability to cook using fewer coals is also its drawback This stove is best suited for slow cooking delicate kebabs fish hot dogs and burgers  not for hot quick searing and grilling of thick steaksOther drawbacks are the vents which do not at least on my unit rotate smoothly And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers  i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stoveAlso being lightweight this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals  especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height cooking on the ground with this thing can be down but for many folks may be uncomfortable I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legsAll in all this stove is OK  it gets the job done I like Weber products even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 yearsI hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18inch given away my 22inch 8 years going strong and newest acquistion the Smokey Joe Silver   \n",

       "      <td>I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee After a short time the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty Now Gilmour is selling them But it's the same hose  Flexogen The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I haveKeep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company Gilmour won't honor the warranty And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or twoLet me reiterate Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses I wrote to them multiple times and was told without explanation that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty you may not get itOn the Gilmour website there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced  On Amazon it does say This heavyduty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement</td>\n",

       "0  I remember my dad using a sprinkler like this when I was a kid I'm 61  We are in the middle of a drought here in Texas and I was tired of having to move the sprinkler and thought this would solve my problem  First of all this is a VERY heavy sprinkler and is awkward to pick up and move  If you have any trouble lifting heavy objects get something else  It has to be moved  You can't drag it and you can't turn it around and make it go the other direction  I have found I have to check on it as often if not more often than I was moving my oscillating sprinkler  First it jumped off the hosetrack and was climbing the fence  Then it kinked the hose and cut off the water  Finally it dug itself a hole and had mud all over the back wheels  Tried it another time and it just stopped spraying water  No kink this time checked the button on the bottom couldn't get it going again  I went back to my oscillating sprinkler  At least it's easy to move around  I think you need to use this on a very flat very straight lawn  Mine is bumpy and I need it to make a couple of gentle curves  It didn't work for me  I like the spray it puts out and would use it as a stationery sprinkler if it weren't so heavy to move                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           \n",
       "1  I purchased 6 of these hoses with what was supposed to be a lifetime guarantee After a short time the end on one of the hoses started leaking so I contacted the manufacturer and got a replacement A year later another hose started leaking and I got another replacement Then another hose started leaking but the company would no longer honor the warranty Now Gilmour is selling them But it's the same hose  Flexogen The hose itself it actually quite good if you don't mind replacing the hose ends eventually I've had to replace every end on every Flexogen hose that I haveKeep in mind that I bought hoses from Flexogen but that company no longer exists and Gilmour would not honor the warranty on those hoses even though Gilmour is now selling them Also note that Flexogen is a patented hose Lifetime warranty isn't much good when the company gets bought or taken over by another company and the new company Gilmour won't honor the warranty And who wants to have to keep sending in hose parts to get a replacement every year or twoLet me reiterate Gilmour would not honor the warranty on my Flexogen hoses I wrote to them multiple times and was told without explanation that Gilmour would not replace the defective hoses If you buy these hoses expecting a lifetime warranty you may not get itOn the Gilmour website there is no longer any information relating to Flexogen hose warranty or on how to have a Flexogen hose replaced  On Amazon it does say This heavyduty garden hose is made in the USA and backed by a lifetime guarantee It also says Lifetime Guarantee on the front of the hose package Gilmour is now owned by the Robert Bosch Corp so probably even less chance of getting a warranty replacement                         \n",

       "4  Am writing this while cooking some chicken on a WSJ i found last week in new condition for a Hamilton Let me preface my comments by stating that I have a 22inch Weber with hinged grate that I loveThe WSJ is small somewhat solidly constructed mine while unused has rust rings around the handle welds that go through the cover  not goodHowever most folks use this Weber as a portable grill Weber for gawd's sakes incorporate some form of simple mechanism ON ALL MODELS to keep the lid on in order to use the carry handle i use a pair of bungees looped every 45 degreesThe stove's best feature the ability to cook using fewer coals is also its drawback This stove is best suited for slow cooking delicate kebabs fish hot dogs and burgers  not for hot quick searing and grilling of thick steaksOther drawbacks are the vents which do not at least on my unit rotate smoothly And trying to adjust the bottom vent to control air flow will result in your burning the beegeebees out of your fingers  i suggest fireproof mitts handling this stoveAlso being lightweight this stove can dramatically shift during your cooking session resulting in the potential for spillage of hot coals  especially if used on a light platform to increase cooking height cooking on the ground with this thing can be down but for many folks may be uncomfortable I'd suggest at least some holes for securing the stove legs to a platform or a way to weigh down the legsAll in all this stove is OK  it gets the job done I like Weber products even if some of the QC and build quality has gone downhill in the last 10 yearsI hope to enjoy my WSJ for as many years as my 18inch given away my 22inch 8 years going strong and newest acquistion the Smokey Joe Silver   \n",

       "7  This window bird feeder works but only stood up to 1 season of use for me before requiring repairs  It's flimsy plastic so you get what you pay forPros Plastic is clear so watching birds is easy The roof does help keep the bird seed dry The suction cups had plenty of holding power and held to the glass through most of the winter The plastic cleaned up well with dish soap and water The limited opening was an effective deterrent to squirrel raidsCons The feeder consists of two halves of plastic that are held together by 5 little nibs along the seam  Through normal use these nibs broke and my feeder started to separate  Luckily super glue works well The opening is only big enough for a single bird in my experience without squabbles A single fall if the suction cups give out will likely result in a broken feederI think it's just ok because it is easily damaged and didn't permit more than one bird to feed at a time  I ultimately upgrade to aSongbird Essentials Recycled Plastic Window Bird Feeder  It's more accessible by squirrels but allows several birds to feed at once without squabbles and is built far more ruggedly than a plastic window feederTip  To increase suction cup strength clean the window well and put a minute amount of cooking oil on the suction cup  It increases holding power significantly   \n",
